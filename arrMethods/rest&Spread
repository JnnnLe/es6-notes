//REST AND SPREAD OPERATORS

//Spread operator permits the fn arg to be dynamic 

//Concat with Spread:
  //let a = [1,2,3];
  //let b = [4,5,6]
    concat: a.concat(b);

  ES6: [...a, ...b]

  ===> [1,2,3,4,5,6];

  Another example:
  lets day you want to add 'blue':
    ['blue', ...a, ...b] ===> 
    ['blue', 1,2,3,4,5,6]


// ...rest (same)
